Dameng Plugin

This plugin was built with the Plugin Builder in QGIS.

Please make sure the dmPython Python extensions are installed!

This plugin is designed for Dameng Database. It can be used to connect to

Dameng Database and import the selected spatial data tables into QGIS (Quantum

Geographic Information System) for display as temporary layers. Additionally, the

plugin allows setting filter conditions for the data in the selected spatial data

tables, such as SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier), data type, and ROWNUM.

ENJOY!

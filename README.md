Dameng Plugin

This plugin was built with the Plugin Builder in QGIS.

This plugin is designed for Dameng Database. It can be used to connect to 

Dameng Database and import the selected spatial data tables into QGIS (Quantum 

Geographic Information System) for display as temporary layers. Additionally, the 

plugin allows setting filter conditions for the data in the selected spatial data 

tables, such as SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier), data type, and ROWNUM.
